Project description:
Created an application that allows the user to input password requirements and generates a random password based on those requirements. The user may decide a minimum and maxiumum number of characters and whether or not they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers or special characters. The application does error checking to make sure only valid responses are made. When the password is created and provided to the user, the password requirements they chose are also listed on the page.
